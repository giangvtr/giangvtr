## Hi there, I'm Giang ! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently a student in **Electronics and Industrial Informatics Engineering**, with a focus on **embedded systems** and an interest in the crossroad of **robotics**, **software**, and **human-centered tech**.

## ðŸ”§ What I'm Building & Breaking
- Embedded C projects for microcontrollers 
- Scripts to automate my Linux life and organize my chaos
- I don't know yet, what's next ?

## ðŸš€ What I'm Learning
- Low-level C & memory management without tears
- **Web Scraping**, because asking websites nicely didnâ€™t work
- Intro to AI using Python, aiming for applications in Smart embedded systems (like edge AI or low-power vision processing) and Collaborative robotics 

## ðŸŽ¯ My Goals
- Become a solid **embedded software engineer** ðŸ§©  
- Contribute to projects that help people (healthcare robotics is my soft spot)  
- Build things that are both elegant and functional

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Tools
- C/C++, Python, Java, SQL
- Arduino, STM32 (soon)
- Linux, Bash, Git

## ðŸ“« Reach Me
- LinkedIn: [your-link]
- Email: [your-email]
- Or just clone a repo and drop a friendly issue

Thanks for stopping by. Always building, always curious!
